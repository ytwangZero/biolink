# biolink: R Package for Multi-Omics Network Analysis of Environmental Exposure-Disease Associations

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **biolink**, an R package developed as a result of the 31st Challenge Cup competition at Peking University.

## Overview

**biolink** is designed to facilitate multi-omics network analysis methods for studying environmental exposure-disease associations. Leveraging data from the NHANES database, this package enables researchers and scholars interested in exposome studies to construct predictive models for disease risk based on exposome data.

## Key Features

- **Integration of Multi-Omics Data**: Combine diverse data types (e.g., genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic) for comprehensive analysis.
- **Network Analysis**: Explore and visualize complex networks to uncover relationships between environmental exposures and disease outcomes.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build predictive models to assess disease risk associated with environmental factors.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed to be accessible and easy-to-use for researchers without specialized computational backgrounds.
